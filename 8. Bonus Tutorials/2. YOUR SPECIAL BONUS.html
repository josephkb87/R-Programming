<p>Hey Data Scientist,</p><p>Congrats on completing the R&nbsp;Programming course!</p><p><em>(Note:&nbsp;if you don't like reading long letters, just skip to the bottom - your bonus is there!)</em></p><p>It was pretty challenging, huh? Matrices, Dataframes&nbsp;and...&nbsp;ggplot2. (That's, hands down, my favourite part - ggplot2.)</p><p>Well, so do you think you&nbsp;know R pretty well now?&nbsp;
</p><p>Of course, you do. Why am I even asking?&nbsp;You've made it to the end of this course!&nbsp;You have a whole arsenal of skills and techniques that you now know.</p><p>But do you know what you can truly do with those skills?...</p><p>Now don't get me wrong. In no way am I&nbsp;saying that you won't find an application to your knowledge. I'm sure you will.
</p><p>I&nbsp;just think there's also a&nbsp;much greater potential for your new skills...</p><p>And what I'm talking about is Machine Learning!<br></p><p>This field is booming through the roof right now. Companies in all industries are throwing themselves at Data Scientists and Analysts who know how to apply Machine Learning.</p><p>(BTW, Machine Learning, or ML,&nbsp;might sound crazy hard. It's not. This R course was hard. ML&nbsp;is a cakewalk compared to what you've already learned!)</p><p>And you know what the good news is?</p><p>The good news is that with your knowledge of R&nbsp;you have opened a door... A door into the great World of ML.</p><p>You see, there are so many different pre-created libraries and scripts that allow you to apply Machine Learning to real-world challenges. And a LOT&nbsp;of them are written in R.</p><p>So all you have to do is get those templates, learn how to apply them... And voila!&nbsp;All of a sudden you have "Machine Learning" on your resume.</p><p>Interested?</p><p>I thought so... Read on.</p><p>The best part is that not so long ago I&nbsp;partnered up with Machine Learning expert Hadelin de Ponteves.&nbsp;</p><p>This guy is nuts!</p><p>He's got a Masters in Machine Learning and&nbsp;has worked at companies like Google and Canal+.&nbsp;</p><p>And together we have created what we think to be&nbsp;one of the World's leading courses on Machine Learning.</p><p>In this course, we teach 7 branches of Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Association Rule Learning, Deep Learning, etc.)&nbsp;and for each branch, we show you from 2 to&nbsp;7 different algorithms...&nbsp;</p><p>...In R&nbsp;and Python (you pick which you want to learn!).&nbsp;Plus,&nbsp;we give you take-away code&nbsp;templates to download and keep.</p><p>Does that sound exciting?</p><p>Well, I really want you to encourage you to keep learning. That's why I want to extend a special student-only invitation into this course to you:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/?couponCode=YESDATAAUGUST" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/?couponCode=YESDATAAUGUST</a></p><p><br></p><p>Use this coupon-coded link&nbsp;to get an exclusive 90%&nbsp;when you sign up.
